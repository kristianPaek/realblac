<p>
<B>Why does it cost money for this app when others are free?</B>
<BR />
We are not just an app, we are a company comprised of a team of passionate and dedicated people with a common mission. We understand that some other apps may be free-of-charge but this is because they appeal to "everyone" and can offer advertising to third-party companies. Dating sites/apps generate company revenue either by allowing advertising or subscription fees. We are a small African-American owned company that target a smaller demographic of people. Therefore, we are not able and most importantly choose not to bombard you with ads to support our hardworking team and their families. A small subscription fee we felt was the best option going forward.

<p>
<B>How can I delete my account?</B>
<BR />
You can deactivate your account in (Change Settings) from the menu section of the app.
</p>
<p>
<B>Why do I have to wait to be accepted?</B>
<BR />
We know how annoying it is to join a dating app or website only to be contacted by spam, fake and scam accounts. We know you are only here to communicate and meet real people. So to ensure the legitimacy of new members we manually approve all new accounts. Yes, it is a lot of work but you are worth it.
</p>
<p>
<B>How do I stop a member from emailing me?</B>
<BR />
You can simply block a member if you wish for the member not to be able to view your profile or communicate with you. If you have already been in communication with a member, at any point of a conversation you can press (End Convo) and the email will disappear from a recipient's inbox like the convo never happened. Once you have ended a convo with a member, they will not be able to email you again unless you initiate a new conversation.
